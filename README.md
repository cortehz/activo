Activo was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br/>
Activo lets users create, view, edit and delete Activities. Activities can also be sorted in order of ascending order of Dates.

## Available Scripts
To run the App: 

Clone this Repo using your terminal or download the zip file. I recommend you clone using: `git clone https://github.com/cortehz/activo.git`

Then go into the project directory by running: `cd activo`

Once you're in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` then run `npm start`

This Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

<br/>

Once the app is running, you can fill the form to add an Activity. An activity can have a title, a start and end time as well as a description. Fill that out and hit the ADD button to see your activity added to the list. You can sort out your activities in order of dates(ascending or descending) by just a push of a button. Below the Activity list are two buttons to edit or delete an activity from the list. Take it for spin.
